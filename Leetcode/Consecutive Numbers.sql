| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.*/


select distinct a.num as ConsecutiveNums
from logs a
join logs b on a.id+1 = b.id and a.Num = b.Num
join logs c on a.id+2 = c.id and a.Num = c.Num
